<h2>Brian</h2>
<ol reversed>
<li>Have you gained weight?</li>
<li>I told you I loved you at our wedding. If something changes I’ll let you know.</li>
<li>Why are you so upset?</li>
<li>You’re nothing special.</li>
<li>You should ask my mom how to cook.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Melissa</h2>
<ol reversed>
<li>Don’t question how she does things in her area of expertise when she’s rushed and you’re just the helper.</li>
<li>Don’t make fun of her really dumb idea/answer while with other people.</li>
<li>“You look the same as you always do.”</li>
<li>“I can’t wait for us to start eating good food again.”</li>
<li>“I’d say you’re a beluga whale.”</li>
</ol>

<h2>Aaron</h2>
<ol reversed>
<li>It’s not the dress that makes you look fat; it’s your fat that makes you look fat. </li>
<li>You’ll get over it.</li>
<li>So, what did you do all day?</li>
<li>Calling her by her mother’s name.</li>
<li>I guess it’s that time of the month, huh?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Rachel</h2>
<ol reversed>
<li>Get in the kitchen and make me a sammich.</li>
<li>Calm down! You’re just being emotional.</li>
<li>Oh! You’re going with the medium? </li>
<li>Just wear more makeup.</li>
<li>Your elbows are starting to show your age.</li>
</ol>
